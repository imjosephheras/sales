<div class="subsection">
    <p><span class="subsection-label">I.</span> PRIME may provide certain administrative or operational services remotely via email, telephone, or videoconference when circumstances reasonably require it. PRIME may also conduct site visits as necessary to obtain documentation, inspect work performance, or address operational issues.</p>

    <p><span class="subsection-label">II.</span> An "Emergency" refers to any unforeseen event that requires immediate action to prevent service interruption, property damage, security risks, or regulatory non-compliance. Emergency visits will be limited to situations where remote resolution is not reasonably feasible.</p>

    <p><span class="subsection-label">III.</span> Any emergency service requiring additional labor, time, or resources beyond the Scope of Work may be billed separately at mutually agreed rates, unless otherwise stated in Schedule A.</p>

<!-- SECTION 13 -->
<div class="section-number">13. Price increase</div>
<div class="subsection">
    <p><span class="subsection-label">I.</span> From the date the contract begins, the prices stipulated in this Agreement will be subject to annual adjustment. On each anniversary of the contract's effective date, the agreed prices for the products or services provided will be increased by (<?php echo $inflation_adj; ?>%) or by any other percentage that the parties agree upon in good faith, considering prevailing market conditions, inflation rates, and other relevant factors.</p>

    <p>PRIME will notify the CLIENT in writing of any price adjustment at least thirty (30) days prior to the renewal date. The CLIENT will have the right to review and discuss the proposed adjustment with PRIME and mutually agree to any modifications before they take effect.</p>

    <p>This arrangement ensures that prices remain fair and reflect the current economic climate, enabling both parties to maintain a successful and mutually beneficial business relationship in the long term.</p>
