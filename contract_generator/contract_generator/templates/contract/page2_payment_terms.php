<!-- SECTION 3 -->
<div class="section-number">3. Payment Terms, Rates and Charges</div>
<div class="subsection">
    <p><span class="subsection-label">I.</span> <strong>Billing and Payment Terms</strong><br>
    PRIME will invoice the CLIENT for services rendered in accordance with Annex A, at the rates specified therein. Billing will be periodic (weekly, monthly, or as otherwise agreed), based on the completion of the tasks described in the Scope of Work. Payment must be made within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.</p>

    <p><span class="subsection-label">II.</span> <strong>Fixed Price Services and Hourly Services</strong><br>
    The CLIENT acknowledges that, while certain services under this Agreement are provided at a fixed price agreed between the CLIENT and PRIME, not all work requested is subject to a single fee.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Depending on the type of work required, some services may be billed hourly at the applicable rates mutually agreed by the CLIENT and PRIME for each category of work.</li>
        <li>PRIME will issue the corresponding invoices, clearly specifying whether the charges correspond to services provided under a fixed price agreement or to services billed hourly.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><span class="subsection-label">III.</span> <strong>Disputed Invoices</strong><br>
    In the event that any part of an invoice is disputed, the CLIENT shall promptly pay the undisputed part, while the parties resolve the disputed amount in good faith.</p>

    <p><span class="subsection-label">IV.</span> <strong>Overtime, Holidays and Weekends</strong><br>
    It is presumed that Prime Associates are not exempt from laws requiring additional pay for overtime, holiday work, or weekend work.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>PRIME will charge the CLIENT special surcharge rates for overtime work only when a Prime Associate, in working on an assignment for the CLIENT, considered on its own, is legally required to receive surcharge pay and the CLIENT has authorized, directed or permitted such work time.</li>
        <li>Surcharge hours will be billed at the same multiple of the regular billing rate that PRIME is legally obliged to apply to the Prime Associate's standard pay rate.</li>
        <li>By way of example, where federal law requires payment of time and a half for work exceeding forty (40) hours per week, the CLIENT will be billed time and a half plus the usual margin on the regular billing rate.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><span class="subsection-label">V.</span> <strong>Adjustments for Increases in Labor Costs</strong><br>
    In addition to the billing rates specified in Schedule A, CLIENT will pay PRIME the amount of all new or increased labor costs associated with Prime Associates that PRIME is legally obligated to pay, including, but not limited to, wages, benefits, payroll taxes, social program contributions, or charges tied to benefit levels, until the parties agree on new billing rates.</p>

    <p><span class="subsection-label">VI.</span> <strong>State Taxes</strong><br>
    The CLIENT acknowledges and accepts that Prime Hospitality Services of Texas will collect applicable state taxes on all goods and services provided under this Agreement.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The rate and method of calculating such taxes will be determined in accordance with the applicable state tax laws and regulations.</li>
        <li>The CLIENT will be responsible for paying these taxes in addition to the fees agreed for the contracted services.</li>
        <li>PRIME will provide the CLIENT with the corresponding documentation and receipts for state tax charges.</li>
        <li>Any changes in state tax rates or regulations will be applied accordingly.</li>
    </ol>
